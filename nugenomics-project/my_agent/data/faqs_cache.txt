    "answer": "The program starts off by studying your “source code” i.e., your DNA. We then combine this information with what we’ve learnt from your blood tests, medical history and lifestyle to get a better-quality picture of your health today and in the future. Next, we analyse this to develop the plan best suited to you and deliver all of it to you in bite-size packages of information that will help kick-start some micro-changes. The program includes- > a pre-counselling session to understand your lifestyle and the goals you aim to achieve > a post counselling session aimed to help you get started. Feel free to reach out to clarify any doubts you may have or regarding any changes that you want to make at any point of time during the course. This program, at the end of the day, is here to help you unlock your potential while you complete the tasks at your own pace.",

    "answer": "Some things just run in our veins whether we like them or not. We’ve listed a few things we look at when building your profile: Metabolic Health- We learn about a lot of fancy sounding things like blood sugar, cholesterol, HDL, LDL (we’ll tell you the full forms when we get there). Nutritional Status- Give your body all the right nutrients & superfoods and it will give you the most out of everything you do. Sensitivities- Sometimes day to day substances like wheat & caffeine have adverse effects on our body. Your gene structure will let us know what does and does not work for your body. Ageing- Do you feel your age? All these body aches and pains tend to make you feel older than you actually are. Wouldn’t it be nice to feel younger for longer? Addictions- In the case of addiction to substances like caffeine & alcohol, the genetics play a vital role. Some people are more susceptible to these addictions and a quick glance into their genes will give us a better idea.",

    "question": "How does genetic information help personalize my program?",
    "answer": "Genetic information helps in eliminating the guesswork from health planning. Your genes tell us what macronutrients you require in what quantities, what your body can’t handle and anything else your body is lacking. Armed with this information we’re able to predict how your body will respond to different kinds of foods and accordingly create a plan that is uniquely suited to you.",

Your information is your personal property and we will do with it as you please. It brings tear to our eyes, seeing you leave but you have the right to delete all your information at the click of a button. We must inform you though, that upon doing so, all your test results and medical records are wiped from our systems. To access any future products, you will have to get yourself tested all over again. In you choose to keep your data, you would have access to future products without needing to get tested again.",
